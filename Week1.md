# Week 1


## Weekly Goals

1. Learn some basic TDD best practices
2. Debug some programs with errors - follow best practices
3. Describe some basic OO principles like encapsulation, SRP
4. Pair using the driver-navigator style


## Plans to achieve week 1 goals:

- Build a **Boris Bikes** application and attend all workshops during the day.
- Work on the auxhillary `dice_app` exercise, that deals with TDD.
- Complete the debugging-related challenges: **Fizzbuzz** & **Cipher** exercises.
- Work on **Airport Challenge** over the weekend to gain a deeper understanding on OOD, TDD and translating User Stories to code.
- During the afternoons work for 3-4 hours with paired partners assigned beforehand. It's important to follow best practices, be empathetic, and supportive.
- Ask for feedback. Workout any knowledge gaps I may have and work on them.

  

## Evidence

### Pair Programming Project - Boris Bikes

Completed **Boris Bikes** application that can dock and release bikes. This challenge showcases a good understanding of how to approach TDD and building a project with ODD in mind. In the beginning, I found that, I struggled with translating User Stories into unit-tests. This initially, seemed to be a weak area of understanding for me. Repo [here]().

- Technologies Used: Ruby, RSpec
- Skills Learnt:
	- Fundamentals of Ruby class structure and intro to OOD
	- Test-drive a simple program using objects and methods
	- Pair-program with the driver-navigator style

  

### Weekend Project - Airport

Completed the **Airport Challenge** that can manage the takeoff and landing of planes in random weather conditions. This application also deals with OOD and showcases a good understanding of TDD. After working on this challenge, I definitely felt, I gained solid insight into translating User Stories into meaningful unit-tests. Had loads of fun building a mini-JFK airport. ðŸ˜Š Repo [here](https://github.com/giorgigutsaevi/airport_challenge).

- Technologies Used: Ruby, RSpec
- Skills Learnt:
	- Reinforcement of fundamentals of Ruby class structure & OOD
	- Build a program using TDD
	- Use an effective debugging process to gain visability


### Auxiliary resources

1. Completed `dice_app`. A TDD-related exercise:
	- Informative step-wise program. Commits demonstrate different stages of unit & feature testing. Repo [here](https://github.com/giorgigutsaevi/dice_app_TDD).
2. Completed a debugging-related exercise: Fizzbuzz & Cipher challenge. Repo [here](https://github.com/giorgigutsaevi/debugging-fizzbuzz-and-cipher).
