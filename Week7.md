# Week 7

## Weekly Goals

By the end of the week all developers can:

- Test-drive a simple Javascript program running in a web browser, using modern JS build tools.
- Use the DOM API to build a web user interface for this program.
- Build a single-page web application fetching and updating remote data using JS.

## Plans to achieve week 7 goals:

- What DOM is
- How JS can be used to manipulate the DOM
- What is a window object in JS
- Reinforce understanding of MVC pattern with JavaScript
- Improve my TDD skills using Jest (a JavaScript testing suite) 
- Build Single Page Applications with JavaScript


## Evidence

### Notes App

#### [Notes Repo here](https://github.com/giorgigutsaevi/JS-notes-app)
Built a notebook app using vanilla JS, HTML & CSS/Bootstrap. 

- Technologies Used: JavaScript, CSS, HTML
- Skills Learnt:
	- Encapsulation with the constructor and prototype pattern
	- DOM Manipulation
	- CSS transitions and animations
	- JavaScript asynchronous behaviour, events, and event handlers (event listeners)

### Weekend Project - News Summary App
#### [News Summary Repo here](https://github.com/giorgigutsaevi/news-summary-challenge)
Created a news summary app which uses Guardian's external API to display the latest 20-30 news headlines. 

- Technologies Used: JavaScript, Axios, Jest
- Skills Learnt:
	- How to plan an app with Object-Oriented design in mind 
	- How to use external API (Guardian's news API in this case)
	- Following good TDD process and maintaining a separation of concerns in JS, which I actually find much harder than in Ruby.
	- Calling various APIs and waiting for a response, wrapping responses in JSON objects, and using event listeners, for instance, have really improved my understanding of asynchronicity in JS.
	- How Event Loop delegates the nature of JS code
