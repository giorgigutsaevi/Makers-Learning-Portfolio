# Week 6

## Weekly Goals

- Test-drive a simple Javascript program using Node.
- Explain how asynchronous programming is different from synchronous, blocking programming.
- Understand what single-threaded JS means.
- Apply a coherent process to learn a new language.
- Understand what is important when tackling a new language

## Plans to achieve week 6 goals:

- Understand how JS engine works
- Understand JS Event Loop and its nature of being a single-threaded language
- The nature of JS Async code
- Fetching data via APIs using native fetch and external packages like Axios
- How classes work in JS
- ES6 features and its modern syntax
