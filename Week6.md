# Week 6

## Weekly Goals

- Test-drive a simple Javascript program using Node.
- Explain how asynchronous programming is different from synchronous, blocking programming.
- Apply a coherent process to learn a new language.

## Plans to achieve week 5 goals:

- Improve my understanding of JS classes
- Reinforce understanding of MVC pattern with JavaScript
- Master the use of callbacks in JS
- Improve my TDD skills using Jest (a JavaScript testing suite) 
- Build Single Page Applications with JavaScript


## Evidence

### Notes App

#### [Notes Repo here](https://github.com/giorgigutsaevi/JS-notes-app)
Built a notebook app using vanilla JS, HTML & CSS/Bootstrap.

- Technologies Used: JavaScript, CSS, HTML
- Skills Learnt:
	- How to build your own testing framework from scratch, inspired by RSpec.
	- Encapsulation with the constructor and prototype pattern
	- JavaScript asynchronous behaviour, events, and event handlers

### Weekend Project - News Summary App
#### [News Summary Repo here](https://github.com/giorgigutsaevi/news-summary-challenge)
Completed backend logic to count a game (10 frames) of a 10-pin bowling game.

- Technologies Used: JavaScript & Jest
- Skills Learnt:
	- How to plan an app with Object-Oriented design in mind 
	- Following good TDD process and maintaining a separation of concerns in JS, which I actually find much harder than in Ruby.
	- Calling various APIs and waiting for a response, wrapping responses in JSON objects, and using event listeners, for instance, have really improved my understanding of asynchronicity in JS.
