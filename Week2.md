# Week 2

## Weekly Goals

1. Use all of week 1's skills
2. Break one class into two classes that work together, while maintaining test coverage
3. Unit test classes in isolation using mocking
4. Explain some basic OO principles and tie them to high level concerns (e.g. ease of change)
5. Review another person's code and give them meaningful feedback

## Plans to achieve week 2 goals:

- Continue practicing TDD in Ruby by completing various challenges
- Continue working through the exercises based on debugging the code
- Read relevant Ruby documentation as I go, and try to extract fundamental concepts 
- Use my note-taking app to continue to create a solid knowledge bank, where I can refer to some key information in the future.
