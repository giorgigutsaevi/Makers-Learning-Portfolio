# Week 2

## Weekly Goals

1. Use all of week 1's skills (don't underestimate the importance of this)
2. Break one class into two classes that work together, while maintaining test coverage
3. Unit test classes in isolation using mocking
4. Explain some basic OO principles and tie them to high level concerns (e.g. ease of change)
5. Review another person's code and give them meaningful feedback

## Plans to achieve week 2 goals:

- Work through the challenges based on TDD and debugging
- Work through the Bank & Piggy Bank TDD exercises
