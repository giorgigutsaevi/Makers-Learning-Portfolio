# Week 2

## Weekly Goals

1. Use all of week 1's skills
2. Break one class into two classes that work together, while maintaining test coverage
3. Unit test classes in isolation using mocking
4. Explain some basic OO principles and tie them to high level concerns (e.g. ease of change)
5. Review another person's code and give them meaningful feedback
6. Understand what Domain model Diagramming is.

## Plans to achieve week 2 goals:

- Continue practicing TDD in Ruby by completing various challenges
- Continue working through the exercises based on debugging the code
- Read relevant Ruby documentation as I go, and try to extract fundamental concepts 
- Read OO principles in the skills-workshop repo. 
- Use my note-taking app to continue to create a solid knowledge bank, where I can refer to some key information in the future. 


## Evidence

### Pair Programming Project - Oystercard
#### [Oystercard Repo](https://github.com/giorgigutsaevi/oystercard).

Completed **Oystercard** application that: tracks the entry and exit stations & corresponding zones, checks the card balance, penalizes sneaky travellers, calculates fare depending on the zones traversed and logs the journey history. This challenge demonstrates core TDD understanding, while building a project with OOD in mind. I found mocking and testing doubles slightly overwhelming in the beginning, but through practice and help from peers/coaches, I managed to understand what they are for and most importantly WHY they are used! 

- Technologies Used: Ruby, RSpec
- Skills Learnt:
	- Apply basic object-oriented principles like encapsulation and single-responsibility.
	- Apply class delegation
	- Isolate classes and use mocking/test doubles
	- Extracting classes: Break one class into two classes that communicate and work together
	- TDD


### Weekend Project - Takeaway application
#### - [Takeaway Repo](https://github.com/giorgigutsaevi/takeaway-challenge)

Built **Takeaway** ordering application with TDD and Twilio API to deliver a confirmation text message after the food has been ordered and confirmed.

- Technologies Used: Ruby, RSpec, Twilio API
- Skills Learnt:
	- Apply OOP principles: delegation, encapsulation
	- How APIs interact with our programs
	- Isolate classes and use mocking/test doubles
	- Incorporate Ruby gems
	- The importance of TDD

### Auxiliary resources

- Wrote code for a little supermarket project: Simple Checkout, which calculates the price of a number of items. Repo [here](https://github.com/giorgigutsaevi/simple-checkout). 
- Completed the TDD a Birthday Tracker Exercise - A practical TDD in Ruby to test-drivr an application to store birthdays. Repo [here](https://github.com/giorgigutsaevi/birthdays).
  

## Daily Goals 
#### Monday - Novemeber 22

GOAL: Review another person's code and attend code review workshop.\
PLAN: Complete code review with my pair partner, give and receive feedback on airport challenge

GOAL: Start working on this week's challenge - Oystercard.\
PLAN: Plan for today is start coding step-by-step. There is no rush, just making sure my partner and I, understand all the concepts mentioned. Before each step is completed we intent to discuss how to approach a problem, and afterwards discuss what we can do better. 

#### Tuesday - November 23

GOAL: Continue Oystercard challenge: breaking one class into two classes or extracting classes.\
PLAN: Use OysterCard challenge as opportunity to refactor some Oystercard class methods into Journey class methods

#### Wednesday - November 24

GOAL: OO Principles: Understand what class delegation is & continue working on the Oystercard challenge in the afternoon.\
PLAN: Read through the key materials on skills-workshop github repo and follow along. Perhaps do an exercise or two regarding this concept. 

#### Thursday - November 25

GOAL: OO Principles: Understand class polymorphism & continue work on the Oystercard challenge in the afternoon.\
PLAN: Read through practicals on OOP and code along. 

#### Friday - November 26

GOAL: Better understand what mocking and test-double principles are in TDD and finish the Oystercard challenge! \
PLAN: Read external resources on mocking and test doubles and why they are used.
