# Week 2

## Weekly Goals

1. Use all of week 1's skills
2. Break one class into two classes that work together, while maintaining test coverage
3. Unit test classes in isolation using mocking
4. Explain some basic OO principles and tie them to high level concerns (e.g. ease of change)
5. Review another person's code and give them meaningful feedback
6. Understand what Domain model Diagramming is.

## Plans to achieve week 2 goals:

- Continue practicing TDD in Ruby by completing various challenges
- Continue working through the exercises based on debugging the code
- Read relevant Ruby documentation as I go, and try to extract fundamental concepts 
- Read OO principles in the skills-workshop repo. 
- Use my note-taking app to continue to create a solid knowledge bank, where I can refer to some key information in the future. 


## Evidence

### Pair Programming Project - Oystercard

Completed **Oystercard** application that tracks the entry and exit station, checks balance, penalizes sneaky travellers, calculates fare depending on the zones traversed and logging journey history. This challenge demonstrates core TDD understanding, while building a project with OOD. I found mocking and testing doubles slightly overwhelming in the beginning, but through practice and help from peers/coaches, I managed to understand what they are for and most importantly WHY they are used! Repo [here](https://github.com/giorgigutsaevi/oystercard).

- Technologies Used: Ruby, RSpec
- Skills Learnt:
	- Apply basic object-oriented principles like encapsulation and single-responsibility.
	- Isolate classes and using mocking/test doubles
	- Extracting classes: Break one class into two classes that communicate and work together
	- TDD

### Auxiliary resources

- Wrote code for a little supermarket project: Simple Checkout, which calculates the price of a number of items. Repo [here](https://github.com/giorgigutsaevi/simple-checkout). 
- Completed the TDD a Birthday Tracker Exercise - A practical TDD in Ruby to test-drivr an application to store birthdays. Repo [here](https://github.com/giorgigutsaevi/birthdays).
