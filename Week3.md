# Week 3

## Weekly Goals

- Build a simple web app
- Follow an effective debugging process for web applications
- Explain the basics of how the web works (e.g. request/response, HTTP, HTML, CSS)
- Explain the MVC pattern

## Plans to achieve week 3 goals:

- Read and work through the exercises based around building web applications & the req/res cycle
- Practice, practice & practice using Sinatra (understand what sessions, how routing works, how to redirect routes, etc.)
- Understand the core concept of Automated Browsers and practice Capybara. 
- Read relevant documentation/articles/knowldge pills as I go, and try to extract fundamental concepts  
- Use my note-taking app to continue to create a solid knowledge bank, where I can refer to some key information in the future. 


## Evidence

### Pair Programming Project - Battle Game

Completed **Battle** web application, a pokemon-inspired battle game. Players can sign-in and battle each other while switching turns. Repo [here](https://github.com/giorgigutsaevi/battle).

- Technologies Used: Ruby, Sinatra, Rspec, Capybara, HTML
- Skills Learnt:
	- How to build a simple web application
  - Web fundamentals, how POST & GET requests work, the cycle between clients and servers
	- Sinatra, what it stands for and how Sinatra echoes the MVC Architecture (routing, Controllers, Models)
	- Applying OOD to building web apps, especially the SRP and encapsulation
	- TDD using RSpec & Capybara

### Weekend Challenge - 


### Auxiliary resources

- Built a Birthday App using Ruby & Sinatra. Users can log in their name & birthday details. If it's their birthday, the next page will greet them with a custom message. Repo [here](https://github.com/giorgigutsaevi/birthday-counter-app)

- Completed a web application (Simple Web Blog) debugging exercise - The exercise emphasizes my understanding of how I approach debugging a program across the stack. Repo [here](https://github.com/giorgigutsaevi/debugging-blog-app).

**Evidence:** Reached step #21!

---

**Goal:** Learn more about HTTP Process Modelling .
**Plan:** Attend a workshop and discuss the subject with my peers.\
**Evidence:** Diagrammed a scenario using HTTP Process Modelling.

#### Wednesday - December 1

**Goal:** Work through the Technical Learning Resources for [Week 3](https://airtable.com/shrlqxQm2BeUDvFyp/tblokmw6yNUO75ge6)!\
**Plan:** Start from the 1st concept from the Week 3's Airtable and start working!

Goal: Work through the [debugging_2](https://github.com/makersacademy/skills-workshops/tree/main/how_the_web_works/debugging_2) exercise\
Plan: Try to solve the challenge and evidence it on my learning-portfolio repo on github,

#### Thursday - December 2

**Goal:** To understand how and to actually debug web applications.
**Plan:** Attend a workshop on the subject and work on the [web blog app](https://github.com/makersacademy/skills-workshops/tree/main/how_the_web_works/debugging_blog_app) example.\
**Evidence:** Fully debugged the app - [Repo link](https://github.com/giorgigutsaevi/debugging-blog-app). Most importantly understood the principles of routing and the entire MVC architecture. 

---

**Goal:** Better understand the MVC architecture in-practice and how Capybara and Sinatra tools tie in with that.
**Plan**: Continue working through the battle-app project the entire afternoon! *(currently on step #27 - skinny controllers)*\
**Evidence:** Finished the battle project completely! Added some slight styling to the play.erb rendering. [Repo link](https://github.com/giorgigutsaevi/battle).


#### Friday - December 3

**Goal:** Gain a deeper understanding on building web apps, while utilising Sinatra & Capybara
**Plan:** Work through a web app practical on skills workshop - [Birthday App](https://github.com/makersacademy/course/blob/main/intro_to_the_web/post_challenges/birthday_app.md).\
**Evidence:**  Completed the Birthday App web app project! [Repo here](https://github.com/giorgigutsaevi/birthday-counter-app)
